## Status

Although we're able to make builds, we don't have a version ready for distribution yet. But we can always use more help! You can make a merge request if you'd like to see something changed, or you can [chat with other developers to find out what needs work](https://discord.gg/suyu).

**Note**: We try to update this README whenever we can, but some links might be broken, and some information may be outdated or irrelevant.

## Development

This project is completely free and open source, and anyone can contribute to help improve suyu.

Most of the development happens on GitLab. For development discussion, please join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/suyu).

You can also contact any of the developers on Discord to learn more about the current state of suyu.

## Downloads

* __Windows__: WIP
* __Linux__: WIP

We don't have any official builds yet! If any website or person is claiming to have a build for suyu, take that with a grain of salt, because it might contain malware. Until we do have an official build, it might be a better idea to keep using the last version of yuzu.

## Building

* __Windows__: [Wiki page](https://gitlab.com/suyu-emu/suyu/-/wikis/Building-for-Windows)
* __Linux__: [Wiki page](https://gitlab.com/suyu-emu/suyu/-/wikis/Building-for-Linux)
